## 👋 Hi, I’m Mir Nafis Sharear Shopnil

I'm an AI/ML Engineer and Researcher with a focus on:
- 🔍 **Misinformation Detection** using Multimodal LLMs (e.g. CLIP, BLIP, InstructBLIP)
- 🔄 **Agentic Workflows** powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Cursor, and vector databases
- 📊 **Real-world Applications** from supply chain ML to ad recommendation systems
- 🤖 **Reasoning with LLMs** via fine-tuning, GRPO, and interpretable model design

### 🌱 Current Interests
- Fine-tuning LLMs and VLMs for **context generation** and **reasoning tasks**
- Building **RAG platforms**, **AI copilots**, and **interactive knowledge systems**
- Exploring **AI safety**, **causal inference**, and **preventing self-replicating autonomous agents**
